Tesla was founded in July 2003, by engineers Martin Eberhard and
Marc Tarpenning, under the name Tesla Motors. The company's name
was derived from engineer Nikola Tesla. In early Series A funding,
Tesla Motors was joined by Elon Musk, J. B. Straubel and Ian Wright,
all of whom are retroactively allowed to call themselves co-founders
of the company. Musk, who formerly served as chairman and is the
current chief executive officer, said that he envisioned Tesla
Motors as a technology company and independent automaker, aimed at
eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average
consumer. Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla in February 2017.
