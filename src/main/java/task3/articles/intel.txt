Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor
pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore (of Moore's law), and
widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of
Andrew Grove. The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of
the words integrated and electronics, with co-founder Noyce
having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip).
The fact that "intel" is the term for intelligence information
also made the name appropriate.[6] Intel was an early developer
of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of
its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first
commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the
success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its
primary business.
